# Releases

## Creating a Release

Releases are automated via GitHub Actions and triggered by git tags.

1. Update `CHANGELOG.md`: move `[Unreleased]` entries to new version section with date
2. Commit the changelog update
3. Create and push a version tag:

```bash
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

The workflow automatically:
- Builds binaries for Linux and macOS (amd64, arm64)
- Creates a GitHub release with changelog
- Uploads binaries and checksums as release assets
- Updates the Homebrew formula in `juanibiapina/homebrew-taps`

## Version Format

Follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/):

- **Production**: `v1.2.3`
- **Pre-release**: `v1.0.0-beta.1`, `v1.0.0-rc.1`, `v1.0.0-alpha.1`

Pre-release tags (containing `-`) are automatically marked as pre-releases on GitHub.

## Installing via Homebrew

After a release, users can install with:

```bash
brew install juanibiapina/taps/mcpli
```
